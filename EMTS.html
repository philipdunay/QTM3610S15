%% Time Series
% A set of measurements taken over time.
%% Trend Components of Time Series
% * *Seasonal components* are short-term patterns
% * *Cyclical components* are long-term patterns
% * *Irregular components* are noisy, unpredicatable patterns
%% Smoothing Methods
% Smoothing methods remove noise from data by averaging time surrounding
% each section of the time series. The result of this is a smoother curve
% that allows a better holistic sense of how the time series is trending.
% Some types of smoothing methods will be outlined below.
%% Simple Moving Average

% the first moving average calculation. Then perform the same operation for
% the rest of the points, the next one being the sum of observations 2-6

%%
% 
% $$log(Y_i) = b_0 + b_1*X_i + b_2*Q_1 + b_3*Q_2 + b4*Q_3$$
% 
%% Time Series Heuristics
% * When two models provide a good fit, go with the simpler one.
% * Choose the model with the smallest measuring error.
% * Examine residuals to eliminate models with patterns or trends.
% * Don't assume that the correlations shown by the model continue
% indefinitely
% * Don't forget that volatility of the estimate increases due to
% unforecasted and unforeseen events.
%% How To Solve These Using SPSS
%
% *<spssexample.htm Click here for an SPSS example
% using the Toys R Us Excel data in the K-Drive>*
%
% Load in the data you wish to use, keep in mind that if you are doing
% seasonal data, you need to enter the quarters or time periods as dummy
% variables and that exponential models should be solved for the logarithm
% of the dependent variable and then raise ten by their powers to finish
% solving for the curve. 
% 
% It becomes very straightforward from here, simply go to Analyze ->
% Regression -> Linear.

% Enter your dependent variable in the appropriate box and all the
