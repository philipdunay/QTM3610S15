%% Analysis of Variance
% Known as ANOVA, this analysis is used to compare the means of the
% variables for significant differences. One-way ANOVA, as its name may
% indicate, is for the comparison of means for one dependent variable, and
% MANOVA is for comparing variable means against those of more than one 
% dependent variable. The ANOVA test is typically used to see if a
% procedure or effect has had any difference on the mean of the observations. 
%
% When performing an ANOVA, the null hypothesis is typically that all of the means
% are the same. You are seeking to disprove this by concluding that the
% means are significantly different, indicating that some action had a
% result on your data. Therefore, it follows that the alternative hypothesis
% is that at least one mean is statistically significant. As a general rule, 
% a 95% percent confidence interval is a good measure, indicating that a
% p-value of .05 or less is required to reject the null hypothesis and
% conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the means.
%% Performing ANOVA in Minitab
% Select ANOVA and choose one- or two-way. In the response section, put the
% dependent variables and in the factor box, the independent. For
% comparisons, use the Tukey comparison. Opt for the confidence interval
% plot and residual plots in the graphs tab.
%% One-way ANOVA Output Example
% *<http://philipdunay.github.io/QTM3610S15/oneway.html Click here
% for an example of one-way ANOVA output performed in Minitab with the data
% below.>*
OneWayTable = [1997 1998 1999; 17 6 4; 13 5 7; 16 5 6; 16 8 7]
%% One-way ANOVA Output Items
% * *Factor Information:* This will identify the number and titles of
% variables being used in the ANOVA.
% * *Analysis of Variance:* The degrees of freedom, sum of squares between groups and mean
% of squares are not of critical importance in this class, we are simply
% looking for the p-value in this table. The F-stat should be fairly large,
% when the p-value is small.
% * *Model Summary:* S is the mean squared error, and the R-squared values
% in this table are indications of how well the model fits the data.
% Typically the R-squared (adjusted) value is used.
% * *Means:* Using the means and standard deviations calculated for each
% variable, it will display those as well as calculate an confidence
% interval based on the specified confidence interval.
% * *Grouping Information w/ Tukey Method:* Groups means by letters,
% showing which means fall into which category and which means are
% significantly different. 
% * *Tukey Tests:* This test is for determining the differenced between the
% means of pairwise variables in your ANOVA, it helps to highlight
% differences.
% * *Tukey Plot:* A plot of the Tukey Test confidence intervals, again,
% helping to highlight differences in the means.
% * *Interval Plot:* Confidence intervals of the means, should be similar
% to a rotated Tukey plot in its appearance. If any difference in the means
% is present, the line should make it obvious.
%% Two-way ANOVA Output Example
% *<http://philipdunay.github.io/QTM3610S15/twoway.html Click here
% for an example of two-way ANOVA output performed in Minitab with the data
% below.>*
%% Interpreting Two-way ANOVA / MANOVA Output
% This goes the same way as interpreting the one-way ANOVA output. If any
% p-value is insignificant, reject because the means for at least one group
% are the same.
%% Key Takeaways From ANOVA Output
% * *p-value:* if this value is under the alpha (1 - confidence interval
% %), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means are different.
% * *Group means:* use the plots and mean confidence intervals to compare
% the group means and determine if means fall into different groups. The
% Tukey Test can also be used here to group means.
% * *R-squared:* Analyze how well the model fits your data by using the
% adjusted R-squared value. The closer it is to 100% the better.
%% MATLAB(R) Functions for (M)ANOVA
% * |[p,tbl,stats] = anova1(y)| - this code will perform a one-way ANOVA
% and return the p-value, a table of descriptive statistics and a stats
% structure, which can be used as the MATLAB(R) function |multcompare|'s
% input. 
% * |[p,tbl,stats] = anova2(y,reps)| - will output the same results as above,
% but for a two-way ANOVA.
% * |[d,p,stats] = manova1(X,group,alpha)| - this will perform a MANOVA test, giving
% a p-value, p, an alpha value, d, and a stats structure. The alpha value
% is the significance level in terms of the dimensionality of the means.
